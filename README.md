# 👋 Sup. I'm @petesimple — like a Pete, but simpler.

Welcome to the most organized chaos this side of the codebase.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in...
- Making apps that make air hockey players look cooler than they are
- Turning spreadsheets into lifeforms
- Gigs, grooves, and Google Apps Script
- Fixing one bug while releasing three more

## 🌱 I’m currently learning...
- How to convince JavaScript to behave
- That CSS is just polite lying
- Why my app only breaks *after* midnight

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...
- Anything involving scoreboards, flashcards, or music-fueled data management
- Open-source tools for fun, learning, or unexplainable vibes
- Projects where "quick fix" means "twelve-hour rabbit hole"

## 📫 How to reach me...
- Carrier pigeon: Not reliable.
- Email: 📩 petesimple at gmail.com
- Smoke signal: Only available during burn bans.
- [helpmegig.com](https://www.helpmegig.com) if you're trying to jam.

## 😄 Pronouns:
He / Him / That Guy Who Built the Weirdly Useful Thing

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I once built a scoreboard app that runs faster than me. (It also sweats less.)
